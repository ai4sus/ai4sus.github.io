                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) for sustainability encompasses innovative applications aimed at addressing environmental challenges and promoting energy efficiency. Our work in this domain focuses on key areas such as Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) for granular energy consumption analysis and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)-based peak shaving to optimize energy usage and reduce demand charges. By integrating advanced AI techniques, these efforts contribute to sustainable energy management and carbon footprint reduction.
                        These technologies are not standalone solutions; they are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. For instance, data from NILM can inform BESS operations by providing detailed insights into usage patterns, enabling better coordination between demand-side management and storage systems. This synergy creates a more adaptive and resilient energy ecosystem.

                        <p class="card-description">
                            This study introduces EVSense, a deep neural network (DNN)-based model designed for non-intrusive detection of electric vehicle (EV) charging events. EVSense enhances precision and scalability by incorporating advanced techniques such as federated transfer learning (FTL), model pruning, and layer normalization. These features allow efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate EVSense's superior performance over existing rule-based and learning-based methods, showcasing its robustness against diverse residential load profiles and varying conditions.

                            This study addresses the challenges of deploying Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) systems in real-world environments by proposing a three-tier framework based on edge-cloud collaboration. The framework distributes lightweight computational tasks to edge devices while leveraging the cloud for more complex tasks, ensuring efficiency and scalability. The implementation integrates Gunicorn and NGINX for better load balancing and concurrency handling. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces response time, alleviates cloud workload, and achieves high decomposition accuracy for NILM tasks, paving the way for practical NILM applications.

                            This study explores the integration of backup batteries as distributed Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) to reduce energy costs for Edge Service Providers (ESPs). The energy costs, primarily composed of energy charges and demand charges, can be significantly mitigated through strategic BESS scheduling. The authors propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach combined with innovations like invalid action masking and prioritized experience replay to optimize BESS operations under dynamic power demands. Experimental results, leveraging real-world edge cloud power traces, demonstrate that this method reduces peak demand charges by up to 27% and overall energy costs by up to 13%.
