 &lt;p>To address the privacy concern in NILM applications, federated learning (FL) could be leveraged for NILM model training and sharing. When applying the FL paradigm in real-world NILM applications, however, we are faced with the challenges of edge resource restriction, edge model personalization, and edge training data scarcity. 
 We design FedNILM, a practical FL paradigm for NILM applications at the edge client. Specifically, FedNILM delivers privacy-preserving and personalized NILM services to large-scale edge clients, by leveraging i) collaborative data aggregation through federated learning, ii) efficient cloud model compression via filter pruning and multi-task learning, and iii) personalized edge model building with unsupervised transfer learning. Our experiments on real-world energy data show that FedNILM can achieve personalized energy disaggregation with the state-of-the-art accuracy, while preserving the user privacy.

 &lt;p>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), as a key load monitoring technology, can much reduce the deployment cost of traditional power sensors. Previous research has largely focused on developing cloud-exclusive NILM algorithms, which often result in high computation costs and significant service delays. To address these issues, we propose a three-tier framework to enhance the real-world applicability of NILM systems through edgecloud collaboration. Considering the computational resources available at both the edge and cloud, we implement a lightweight NILM model at the edge and a deep learning based model at the cloud, respectively. In addition to the differential model implementations, we also design a NILM-specific deployment scheme that integrates Gunicorn and NGINX to bridge the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical applications. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we apply real-world NILM scenario settings and implement the entire process of data acquisition, model training, and system deployment. The results demonstrate that our framework can achieve high decomposition accuracy while significantly reducing the cloud workload and communication overhead under practical considerations.
